# Netflix_Clone
This is the first project that I did back in 2021, my first HTML and CSS project.
It was my final project from [Pirple](https://www.pirple.com)
Check out their webpage to learn;
* HTML 
* CSS 
* JS 
* NODE.JS 
* REACT.JS 
* PYTHON 
* JAVA 
* C# 
* C 
* C++ 
* SWIFT 

and many more
This is a presentation of Netflix webpage built only using HTML5 &amp; CSS3.  I hope that it might be of help to newbies learning web development using HTML, CSS and Javascript.
